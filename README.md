# Gamification-Server
The server code for my Capstone Project

This is C# code I created as the server for the main project of the Capstone Project I was in. The server was meant to interact between a MongoDB database and the client for saving and loading user data.

NOTE: I'm not sure that this is the complete/final version of the code. This was just what was on my computer before the university server switched from Github to Gitlab. I am trying to see if I can still get the final code.
